This package allows you to create a custom, patched version of tzdata
with corrected australian timezone names. The patch applied is from Ted
Percival:

    http://tedp.id.au/tzdata-au/

THE URL to the SRPM is configured in the Makefile. You will need to
change it if you want to rebuild the RPM for a different SRPM. This may
also mean that you will need to change the additional patches for the
tzdata tests and the tzdata.spec file.

        Additional build flags can be set with the BFLAGS environment
        variable, e.g. BFLAGS='-ba --nodeps' make
