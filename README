This package allows you to create a custom, patched version of tzdata
with corrected australian timezone names. The patch applied is from Ted
Percival:

    http://tedp.id.au/tzdata-au/

THE URL to the SRPM is configured in the Makefile. You will need to
change it if you want to rebuild the RPM for a different SRPM. This may
also mean that you will need to change the additional patches for the
tzdata tests and the tzdata.spec file.

Additional Build Flags
======================

    BFLAGS:
        Additional build flags can be set with the BFLAGS environment
        variable, e.g. BFLAGS='-ba --nodeps' make

What to do
==========

Download the source RPM and find the files that need to be patched (tzdata.spec and tzdataXXXXy/australasia) and make the necessary changes to them.
For tzdata.spec this involves adding information about the patch to tzdataXXXXy/australasia (see patches/tzdata.spec.patch for an idea of what to change).
Once you've made the changes, regenerate the diffs:
> diff -u tzdata.spec tzdata.spec_patched > tzdata.spec.patch
For australia-names.diff it's a bit different. There is an outdated version at http://tedp.id.au/~ted/australia-names.diff (and Lord Howe island being on ACST unitl 1981 also seems like a mistake). The diff can be generated by copying the latest australasia file across, updating it as necessary, then copying the output of git diff tzdata/australasia into australia-names.diff
The current australasia file is from tzdata-2013g-1.el6.src.rpm/tzdata2013g.tar.gz/

Copy these new files into the repo and update Makefile so that SRCRPMURL refers to the version this is being updated for.
